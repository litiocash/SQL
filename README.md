Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions.




**Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project**

**Introduction**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team i s planning to use i ts existing movie l icenses to
launch an online video rental service i n order to stay competitive.

You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business i ntelligence (BI)
department to help with the l aunch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from i nventory to customer i nsights, with data-related
queries. Your first task i s to l oad all of Rockbuster’s data i nto a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll
need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile
the results of your analysis i nto an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the
Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

**Key Questions and Objectives**

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
● Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**Context**

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, you’ll query the data using SQL
(short for structured query l anguage). Throughout this Achievement, you’ll l earn SQL
incrementally, and you’ll use i t to answer i ncreasingly complex business questions for each
task. The results of your analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, so you’ll
need to visualize the data i n an easy-to-consume manner. In other words, you’ll build on what
you’ve l earned i n previous Achievements.

Although you’ll be working with data from the online video streaming i ndustry for this
project, the skills you develop could be applied to any i ndustry and will highlight your ability
to solve problems for a variety of clients. The aim i s to give you hands-on experience with
SQL. By the time you finish your project, you’ll be able to use SQL to perform various kinds of
query-based analyses.

**Data Set**

In this Achievement, you’ll be using a data set that contains i nformation about Rockbuster’s
film i nventory, customers, and payments, among other things. The first thing you’ll need to
do is load the data set i nto the PostgreSQL database.
